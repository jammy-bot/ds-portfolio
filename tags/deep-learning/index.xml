      <description>Binary classification using sklearn pipeline, sequential feature selection, multiple algorithm comparison, hyperperameter tuning, and XGBoost | Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people.</description>

      <description>Using PyTorch to Identify Model Influences This project explores a machine learning package designed to identify which training data exert the most influence over a neural network models outcomes. It is based on the nimarb reimplementation of Influence Functions from the ICML2017 best paper: Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions by Pang Wei Koh and Percy Liang. The reference implementation can be found here: link.
The Dataset The project makes use of the CIFAR-10 image dataset, which consists of 50000 training images and 10000 test images in 10 classes.</description>
