      <description>Multiple linear regression, SQLite3, PandaSQL | Introduction This project focuses on using data concerning recently successful movie titles. The goal is analysis helpful to the launch of a new studio.
Objectives This project explores the following questions and why:
 What are the recent top titles, by gross earnings? Which are the top performing studios? How fluid are their rankings What are the most frequently produced genres? &amp;hellip;The biggest earning? What is the genre mix for top studios?</description>

      <description>Using PyTorch to Identify Model Influences This project explores a machine learning package designed to identify which training data exert the most influence over a neural network models outcomes. It is based on the nimarb reimplementation of Influence Functions from the ICML2017 best paper: Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions by Pang Wei Koh and Percy Liang. The reference implementation can be found here: link.
The Dataset The project makes use of the CIFAR-10 image dataset, which consists of 50000 training images and 10000 test images in 10 classes.</description>
